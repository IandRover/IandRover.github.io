Hello, I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Cornell University, and I also hold a medical license in Taiwan.

I've had the privilege of collaborating with Dr. [Pin-Yu Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage) at MTI-IBM Watson AI Lab, Prof. [Chiu-Wei Chen](https://walonchiu.github.io/) and Prof. [Li-Fen Chen](https://bml.ym.edu.tw/ibs/Members/LFChen-e.html) at NYCU, and NVIDIA Research Director Prof. [Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/).

My primary research interest lies in understanding the underlying mechanisms and implicit inductive biases of machine learning models and algorithms. I aspire to contribute to the development of robust and interpretable machine learning systems, designed to excel in challenging conditions.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
